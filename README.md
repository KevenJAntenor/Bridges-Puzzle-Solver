# Bridges Puzzle Solver in Prolog

## Description

This project implements a Prolog-based solver and validator for the "Bridges" puzzle game. The Bridges puzzle is a logic game where the goal is to connect islands with bridges, adhering to specific rules.

### Key Features:

- **Puzzle Validation**: Ensures that the input puzzle grid is valid and well-formed.
- **Solution Legality Check**: Verifies if a proposed solution follows the basic rules of bridge placement.
- **Connection Verification**: Checks if bridges properly connect islands without intersecting.
- **Island Connection Validation**: Ensures each island has the correct number of connections as specified in the puzzle.
- **Complete Solution Validation**: Combines all checks to validate a full puzzle solution.
- **Puzzle Solving Capability**: Can generate solutions for given puzzles using logical inference.

This implementation serves as both a tool for verifying Bridges puzzle solutions and a solver capable of generating valid solutions for given puzzles. It demonstrates the power of logic programming in solving combinatorial puzzles efficiently.
